This program is to be done in a cmd window.

To run:

arg 1: A map text file of connected cities, where each line has the names of the cities and their distance between them. Some cities can be in a different area and won't connect with certain cities, ex: Austin is in Texas and isn't connected to cities in Oklahoma.

arg 2: starting city

arg 3: ending city


Decscription:
First the program will build a map/web of the cities first then preforms a BFS, where it doesn't keep track of the visted cities, to find shortest path. 


Result:

Will give you the route from starting cities to the ending location and the cost.
EX: El_Paso Amarillo
Distance: 36 km
Route:
El_paso to Odessa, 11 km
Odessa to Midland, 5 km
Midland to Lubbock , 20 km
Lubbock to Amarillo, 10 km

If it can't find the city it means that the two cities werent connected. 
EX: Austin Oklahoma_city
Distance: infinity
Route: none


If the start is the same as the end then no route was found
EX: Austin Austin
Distance: 0 km
Route:
Austin to Austin, 0 km
